        ### Fairness in Machine Learning
        
        Fairness in machine learning is about ensuring that the model doesn't discriminate against 
        certain groups of people based on sensitive attributes like gender, race, or age.
        
        **Key Fairness Metrics:**
        - **Equalized Odds Difference**: Measures whether the model has equal false positive and 
          false negative rates across different demographic groups. Lower values indicate better fairness.
        
        - **Demographic Parity**: Measures whether the acceptance rate is the same across different demographic groups.
        
        - **Accuracy Gap**: The difference in model accuracy between different demographic groups.
        
        **Our Approach to Fairness:**
        This application improves fairness by:
        1. Identifying rejected applications from protected groups
        2. Generating fair counterfactual examples
        3. Augmenting the training data with these examples
        4. Retraining the model to reduce bias
        
        By adding counterfactual examples that show reasonable paths to approval for protected groups,
        we help the model learn fairer decision boundaries without sacrificing overall performance.

        ### Counterfactual Explanations
        
        Counterfactual explanations show what changes would be needed to get a different outcome from the model. 
        They answer the question: *"What would need to be different about this loan application to get it approved?"*
        
        **Benefits:**
        - Provides actionable insights for loan applicants
        - Makes model decisions more transparent
        - Helps address potential biases in the model
        
        **Example:**
        If a loan was rejected, a counterfactual might show that increasing income by $10,000 
        or improving credit history would change the prediction to 'approved'.
        
        **Interpretation:**
        - Each counterfactual (CF) shows a set of changes that would flip the prediction
        - The fewer changes required, the closer the application is to approval
        - Some features might be easier to change than others

    **Interpreting Feature Impact:**
    - Positive values (green) push the prediction toward approval
    - Negative values (red) push the prediction toward rejection
    - Larger absolute values indicate stronger influence on the model's decision
    
    In this example, good Credit History and high Applicant Income strongly favor approval, 
    while high Loan Amount and being Female (in the baseline model) push toward rejection.

    **Key improvements after counterfactual augmentation:**
    
    1. **Demographic Parity increased by 27%**: The model now gives similar approval rates across different demographic groups.
    
    2. **Equal Opportunity increased by 27%**: Protected groups with good qualifications are now much more likely to be approved.
    
    3. **Predictive Parity improved by 16%**: The model's precision is more balanced across demographic groups.
    
    4. **Equalized Odds improved by 28%**: False positives and false negatives are more balanced across demographic groups.
    
    These improvements show how counterfactual data augmentation can significantly reduce bias while maintaining model performance.
