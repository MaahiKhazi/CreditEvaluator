        ### Fairness in Machine Learning
        
        Fairness in machine learning is about ensuring that the model doesn't discriminate against 
        certain groups of people based on sensitive attributes like gender, race, or age.
        
        **Key Fairness Metrics:**
        - **Equalized Odds Difference**: Measures whether the model has equal false positive and 
          false negative rates across different demographic groups. Lower values indicate better fairness.
        
        - **Demographic Parity**: Measures whether the acceptance rate is the same across different demographic groups.
        
        - **Accuracy Gap**: The difference in model accuracy between different demographic groups.
        
        **Our Approach to Fairness:**
        This application improves fairness by:
        1. Identifying rejected applications from protected groups
        2. Generating fair counterfactual examples
        3. Augmenting the training data with these examples
        4. Retraining the model to reduce bias
        
        By adding counterfactual examples that show reasonable paths to approval for protected groups,
        we help the model learn fairer decision boundaries without sacrificing overall performance.

        ### Counterfactual Explanations
        
        Counterfactual explanations show what changes would be needed to get a different outcome from the model. 
        They answer the question: *"What would need to be different about this loan application to get it approved?"*
        
        **Benefits:**
        - Provides actionable insights for loan applicants
        - Makes model decisions more transparent
        - Helps address potential biases in the model
        
        **Example:**
        If a loan was rejected, a counterfactual might show that increasing income by $10,000 
        or improving credit history would change the prediction to 'approved'.
        
        **Interpretation:**
        - Each counterfactual (CF) shows a set of changes that would flip the prediction
        - The fewer changes required, the closer the application is to approval
        - Some features might be easier to change than others
